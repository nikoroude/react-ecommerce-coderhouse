# _*Tech Shop E-commerce*_ 🖥

## About 📋

_This project consists of an electronic commerce application._
_In order to use it, the user must log in or create a new account._
_Once inside the app, the user can browse the different categories, selecting products to see their information in detail. You can add the products you want to the shopping cart, always depending on their stock._
_Within the cart, the user will be able to review their purchase before generating an order. This order has a unique and unrepeatable ID, which will be delivered to the user once they confirm their purchase and enter their shipping and email information._
